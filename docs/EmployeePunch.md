## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**employeeId** | **String** | Unique Identifier of the Employee in Paycor&#39;s system. Generated by Paycor. |  |
|**departmentId** | **String** | Unique identifier of the department in Paycor&#39;s system. Generated by Paycor. |  |

|**punchStatusType** | **PunchStatusType** |  |  |
|**activityTypeId** | **String** | Unique identifier for the Activity Type. |  |
|**isTransfer** | **Boolean** | IsTransfer property serves as an indicator in identifying a transfer punch. When set to &#39;true&#39; this property designates a punch as a transfer punch. To appropriately handle a transfer punch ensure that the &#39;PunchStatusType&#39; is set to value &#39;Transfer&#39; when sending a payload. If &#39;PunchStatusType&#39; is set to a value other then &#39;Transfer&#39; and &#39;IsTransfer&#39; is set to &#39;true&#39;, PunchStatusType value will get ignored in most of the cases. Transfer punch is essential for tracking and management of employee transfers during the working hours. Transfer punches find their use in scenarios where an employee undergoes a change in department or labor type. By adding a transfer punch the application effectively captures these transitions providing an overview of employee movements between different departments or labor types. |  |
